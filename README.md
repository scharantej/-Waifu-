 **Problem Analysis**

The problem is to build an application that creates Japanese anime movies. The application should allow users to create anime movies by selecting from a variety of characters, backgrounds, and music. The application should also allow users to save their movies and share them with others.

**Design**

The application will be a Flask application. The following are the HTML files that will be needed for the application:

* `index.html`: This will be the home page of the application. It will contain a form that allows users to select from a variety of characters, backgrounds, and music.
* `create.html`: This page will display the movie that the user has created. It will also allow users to save their movies and share them with others.
* `saved.html`: This page will display a list of the movies that the user has saved.
* `shared.html`: This page will display a list of the movies that the user has shared with others.

The following are the routes that will be needed for the application:

* `/`: This route will render the `index.html` page.
* `/create`: This route will render the `create.html` page.
* `/save`: This route will save the movie that the user has created.
* `/share`: This route will share the movie that the user has created with others.
* `/saved`: This route will render the `saved.html` page.
* `/shared`: This route will render the `shared.html` page.

**Implementation**

The application can be implemented using the following steps:

1. Create a new Flask application.
2. Add the HTML files to the application.
3. Add the routes to the application.
4. Implement the logic for the application.
5. Test the application.

**Deployment**

The application can be deployed to a web server. The following are some of the options for deploying a Flask application:

* Heroku
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Google App Engine
* DigitalOcean

**Conclusion**

The application that has been designed and implemented in this document is a simple application that allows users to create Japanese anime movies. The application is easy to use and can be deployed to a web server.
